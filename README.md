# Réjean McCormick · Socio-technical Architect

I design and ship civic utilities: shared infrastructure that helps people learn, coordinate, and govern together.

### Core Projects
* **[KOA](#koa-the-ecosystem)** – A modular civic ecosystem
* **[Konnaxion](./Konnaxion/Home.md)** – Knowledge and civic platform
* **[Orgo](./Orgo/Home.md)** – Nervous system for organisations
* **Movement & Narrative** – Political program and story engine around King Klown

## KOA: The Ecosystem

**KOA** (Konnaxion + Orgo + narrative layer) is a public-good ecosystem that links:
1.  People
2.  Knowledge and methods
3.  Projects and institutions

Across four main spaces:
* **KonnectED** – Learning, micro-credentials, re-use of global best practice.
* **keenKonnect** – Open R&D, builds, and deployments.
* **Ethikos / Smart Vote** – Structured debate, consultations, and weighted readings of results.
* **Kreative** – Culture, archives, and patronage.

A shared spine handles identity, domain-specific merit, ethics-aware weighting (Ekoh), and auditable decision flows (Smart Vote). The same mechanics power education, collaboration, governance, and culture.

## Konnaxion · Knowledge & Civic Platform

**[👉 Access Konnaxion Technical Documentation](./Konnaxion/Home.md)**

Konnaxion is the software implementation of KOA’s “knowledge platform”:
* Connects learning, R&D, consultations, and cultural projects into one workspace.
* Links out to existing OER catalogs, maker libraries, and civic tools instead of duplicating them.
* Provides multiple “readings” of any consultation or decision (raw crowd, expertise-weighted, stakeholder-specific).
* Publishes a limited, curated library of validated debates, blueprints, and learning sequences for fast reuse.

## Orgo · Nervous System for Organisations

**[👉 Access Orgo Technical Documentation](./Orgo/Home.md)**

Orgo is a multi-tenant nervous system for organisations:
* Ingests signals (emails, forms, APIs, imports).
* Normalises them into **Cases** and **Tasks** under a shared schema.
* Routes them using labels and roles, with clear ownership.
* Tracks execution, escalations, and periodic reviews.
* Feeds an **Insights** layer so leaders can see bottlenecks, risks, and recurring patterns.

*Target domains: administrations, schools, hospitals, NGOs, co-ops, and complex ops teams that want one backbone instead of fragmented ticketing tools.*
