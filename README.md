# Réjean McCormick
### Socio-technical Architect

I design and ship civic utilities: shared infrastructure that helps people learn, coordinate, and govern together.

My work bridges rigid technical systems with fluid narrative layers. I build engines that deconstruct linear human language into structured, universal concepts—enabling organizations to be faster, smarter, and independent.

## ⚖️ The Strategy: Connection vs. Independence

My architecture is built on a deliberate balance between two opposing needs:

1.  **Global Connection (Konnaxion):** A public ecosystem to connect everyone and share knowledge openly.
2.  **Hermetic Independence (Orgo):** A private, closed-network nervous system for organizations that need absolute data sovereignty.

To achieve this without relying on external "Big Tech" APIs or constant internet access, I had to build my own engines.

## ⚙️ The Engines (Core Logic)

These are the active processors that power the ecosystem.

### 🧠 SenTient: The Deconstructor
**Status:** *Active Development (Open Source)*
To make Orgo and Konnaxion truly independent, I needed a "language deconstructor" that could operate offline, without relying on external LLMs.
* **The Build:** I merged the best features of **OpenTapioca**, **Falcon**, and **OpenRefine** into a single, streamlined tool.
* **The Function:** It deconstructs linear human sentences and maps them into structured Wikidata items (concepts).
* **The Goal:** Enable language-independent data flow within private bubbles (Orgo) or public networks (Konnaxion).

### 🏗️ Abstract Wiki Architect
**Status:** *Active Development (Open Source)*
To make Konnaxion available to all, I needed a way to generate multilingual articles from abstract data. Since no existing solution was ready, I initiated building this architect.
* **Role:** Structural design and relationship mapping for the wiki ecosystem.

## 🏗️ The Ecosystem: KOA

**KOA** is the public-good ecosystem built on top of these engines.

### 1. Konnaxion (The Open Web)
* **Mission:** Connect everyone. Stitches together existing OER catalogs and civic tools rather than rebuilding them.
* **Modules:** KonnectED (Education), keenKonnect (R&D), Ethikos (Governance), Kreative (Culture).
* 👉 [Access Konnaxion Technical Wiki](Konnaxion/README.md)

### 2. Orgo (The Hermetic Bubble)
* **Mission:** Organize and Go. A multi-tenant nervous system for organizations (gov, business, schools).
* **Independence:** Designed to operate in a "bubble" (closed network). It uses SenTient to process information locally, ensuring total privacy and speed without data leaks.
* 👉 [Access Orgo Technical Wiki](Orgo/README.md)

## 🧩 Commercial & Research Modules

Specific architectural components that handle intelligence and navigation.

### 🧭 Ariane (Commercial)
**Status:** *For Sale / Commercial Licensing*
The "Thread" and navigation system. Ariane handles graph models and ontology vocabularies (Atlas) to guide users through complex data structures.
* 👉 [Read the Docs](Ariane/README.md)

### 🐝 SwarmCraft
**Status:** *Research / Open Source*
Managing swarm intelligence and prompt engineering pipelines. Focuses on deterministic execution and slice-by-slice orchestration.
* 👉 [Read the Docs](SwarmCraft/README.md)

### 👻 Ame-Artificielle (Artificial Soul)
**Status:** *Research / Open Source*
Concepts of AI alignment and meta-cognition. Defines ethics, governance, and functional specifications for synthetic souls.
* 👉 [Read the Docs](Ame-Artificielle/README.md)

## 🎭 The Narrative Layer

To make these systemic ideas legible and engaging, I utilize a narrative engine around **King Klown** and **Surreal**.

* **Fiction Cycles:** *King Klown Kronicles* (Amazon).
* **Media:** Podcasts, audiobooks, and soundscapes (YouTube).
* **Stage Work:** *Le Ninja Arc-en-ciel*.
